/*
The level is represented as a grid. The position is given by the cellX and cellY (indexing starts at 0).
The total number of cells in x axis (width) and cells in y axis (height) is odd.

The level is defined by rules:
- Indestructible blocks at the borders and if the cellX and cellY are even.
- Character (Player/Enemy) positions are predefined: Currently 4 characters at the corners.
- The horizontal and vertical neighbor tiles of the characters are empty.
- Destructible blocks at the remaining positions (spawned at a defined probability).

Note: The order of the rules matters. Only the first rule that meets the condition applies.
